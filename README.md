# Logitech-.Net-SDK v1.0
<h5>Unofficial simplified SDK for Logitech products</h5>

This is a full unofficial simplified version of the Logitech SDK available for .Net programmers.

There is an official SDK available on the Logitech website. But it only provides .Net programmers through C++ DllImport.
Also i found their documentation to be hard to understand and does not provide any error checking.

Do whatever you want with the SDK. I'm currently playing around with it.
